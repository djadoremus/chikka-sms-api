I'm still trying out python (technically, I'm still a noob at it) as the first iteration of this project is for the AngelHack 2014 hackathon. I've cleaned it up and am trying the Flask-Classy extension, but it seems to have a 1 Class - 1 POST method limitation; I still have to look into it though.


You can contribute to this project as well, just fork a copy and if there are changes that can be added, lets see what we can do about it.
